Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(pymol): Add complete PyMOL script with rendering options

Enhanced the PyMOL visualization script with ligand highlighting, binding sites, 
and high-quality rendering configuration.

Complete features:
- Color organic ligands cyan for visibility
- Identify binding sites (residues within 5Å of ligands)
- Color binding site residues grey
- Highlight tryptophan residues magenta
- Show ligands and binding sites as sticks
- Export as PNG with ray-tracing at 300 DPI

Advanced rendering options:
- set ray_shadows, 0: Clean rendering without shadows
- set antialias, 2: Smooth edges
- set orthoscopic, on: Orthographic projection for publication
- Ray-traced output: protein_visualization.png

Rationale:
Publication-quality figures require careful rendering settings. These enhancements 
provide comprehensive visualization showing ligands, binding sites, and key 
residues with professional appearance suitable for scientific publications.

Verified: Script generates high-quality rendered images with all features.
