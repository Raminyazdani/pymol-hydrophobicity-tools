Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(extraction): Start implementing get_residues function

Started building the residue extraction pipeline by creating the get_residues() 
function skeleton and adding support for configurable output file naming.

Changes:
- Added OUTPUT_PREFIX environment variable support with default 'hydrophobicity'
  This allows users to customize output filenames via HYDROPHOBICITY_OUTPUT_PREFIX
- Created get_residues(pdb_file) function skeleton
- Set up basic structure for reading PDB files and extracting amino acids
- Added necessary imports (os, sys for environment and exit handling)

Rationale: Before calculating hydrophobicity, we need to extract amino acid 
residues from PDB structures. This function will filter the PDB file to find 
relevant residues (typically from chain A, using CA atoms as representatives). 
Starting with the function structure and environment variable setup establishes 
the pattern.

The environment variable approach allows output customization without hardcoding 
student names or requiring code changes, making the tool more flexible and 
portfolio-appropriate.

Next step: Implement the full residue extraction logic with chain and atom filtering.

Verified: Function skeleton compiles, environment variable loads correctly.
