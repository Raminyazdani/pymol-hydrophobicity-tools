Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(parser): Add get_template_pdb helper method

Added the first parsing method to RaminCalc class - a helper function for 
splitting PDB lines according to format templates.

Implemented get_template_pdb(line, template) method:
- Takes a PDB line string and a template format (e.g., "6s5s1s4s")
- Splits the line according to template column widths
- Handles whitespace and fixed-width column parsing
- Returns list of extracted fields

Example usage:
template = "6s5s1s4s"  # For ATOM record: 6 chars, 5 chars, 1 char, 4 chars
fields = RaminCalc.get_template_pdb(pdb_line, template)

Rationale: The PDB format uses rigid column-based positioning. This helper 
method provides the core functionality for parsing any PDB line type by 
splitting according to template patterns. Building this foundation first makes 
implementing the higher-level methods (get_data_pdb, get_custom_data_pdb) easier.

This follows the software development principle of building low-level utilities 
first before composing them into higher-level functions.

Next step: Add get_data_pdb and get_custom_data_pdb methods that will use this helper.

Verified: Method correctly splits test PDB lines according to templates.
