Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(extension): Add smooth_values helper function (basic)

Added initial implementation of smoothing functionality for the PyMOL extension.

Implemented smooth_values() helper function:
- Takes list of hydrophobicity values and window_size parameter
- Uses sliding window averaging algorithm
- For each position, averages values within the window

Basic implementation:
- Simple loop through values
- Window slicing: values[i:i+window_size]
- Average calculation: sum(window) / len(window)
- Returns smoothed list

Rationale:
Smoothing is essential for the PyMOL extension to match the CLI tool's 
functionality. This initial implementation provides the core algorithm.

Next step: Optimize for edge cases and performance.

Verified: Function correctly averages values with various window sizes.
