Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(parser): Add RaminCalc class skeleton for PDB parsing

Implemented the basic infrastructure for PDB file parsing by creating the 
RaminCalc utility class in calculate_hydrophobicity.py.

This class will serve as the foundation for extracting structured data from 
PDB (Protein Data Bank) format files. The skeleton includes:
- Class definition with __init__ constructor
- Import statements for BioPython's PDB module
- Placeholder for static methods to parse PDB line formats

Rationale: Starting with the class structure helps organize code from the 
beginning and provides a clear pattern for building out full functionality. 
The PDB format uses fixed-width columns, so a dedicated parser utility will 
be essential for reliable data extraction.

Next steps: Implement the actual parsing methods (get_data_pdb, 
get_custom_data_pdb, get_template_pdb) to handle PDB format specifications.

Verified: Class structure compiles without errors, ready for method implementation.
