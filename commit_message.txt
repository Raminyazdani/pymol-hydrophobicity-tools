Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(analysis): Add single additional window size (window=5)

Extended the CLI to generate a second plot with window size 5 for comparison.

Changes:
- Added loop to process window_sizes [5]
- Call compute_hydrophobicity and plot for each window size
- Generate separate plot: {OUTPUT_PREFIX}_plot_window5.png
- Keeps existing functionality intact

Rationale:
Different window sizes reveal different features in protein structure:
- Small window (3): Shows local hydrophobicity variations
- Medium window (5): Balances noise reduction with feature preservation

Generating multiple window sizes allows researchers to compare and choose the 
most appropriate smoothing level for their analysis goals. This is a first step 
toward comprehensive multi-window analysis.

Next step: Expand to full range of window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9).

Verified: Two plots generated successfully with different window sizes.
