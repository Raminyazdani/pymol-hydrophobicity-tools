Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(testing): Add pytest unit tests for get_residues and compute_hydrophobicity

Implemented comprehensive unit test suite to ensure correctness of core 
functionality and prevent regressions.

Test suite includes:
- Created test_calculate_hydrophobicity.py with pytest framework
- Fixtures for creating temporary test PDB files with known residue sequences
- test_get_residues(): Validates residue extraction from PDB files
  * Verifies correct residue sequence extraction
  * Confirms CA atom filtering works correctly
  * Tests chain A filtering
- test_compute_hydrophobicity(): Validates hydrophobicity calculations
  * Tests correct mapping of residues to Kyte-Doolittle values
  * Verifies raw hydrophobicity value accuracy
  * Validates smoothing algorithm with different window sizes

Running tests:
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest test_calculate_hydrophobicity.py -v
```

Expected output:
- test_get_residues: PASSED
- test_compute_hydrophobicity: PASSED

Rationale:
Unit tests are essential for scientific software where accuracy is critical. 
Tests provide:
- Confidence in correctness of calculations
- Protection against regressions when refactoring
- Documentation of expected behavior
- Validation that Kyte-Doolittle values are correctly mapped
- Verification that smoothing algorithm works as intended

Tests use realistic PDB format data to validate actual usage patterns. The 
fixtures create temporary PDB files with known sequences, allowing deterministic 
validation of output.

This follows best practices for scientific computing: computational results 
must be verifiable and reproducible through automated testing.

Verified: All tests pass, functions behave correctly with known input/output pairs.
