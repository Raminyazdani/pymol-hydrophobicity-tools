Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(extension): Complete PyMOL extension with full hydrophobicity coloring

Finished the complete PyMOL extension implementation for interactive real-time 
hydrophobicity visualization in loaded protein structures.

Complete implementation:
1. Extract residues from PyMOL's loaded structure using get_residues()
2. Map each residue to Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity values
3. Apply smoothing window if window_size > 1 using smooth_values()
4. Store hydrophobicity values in each residue's B-factor field
5. Apply color gradient using PyMOL's spectrum command with selected palette
6. Color by B-factor (which now contains hydrophobicity values)
7. Provide user feedback messages for successful coloring

Usage examples:
```python
# Basic usage (default: chain A, blue_white_red palette, no smoothing)
PyMOL> run hydrophobicity_pymol.py
PyMOL> fetch 1ubq
PyMOL> hydrophobicity

# Advanced usage (specify selection, palette, window size)
PyMOL> hydrophobicity chain B, blue_white_magenta, 5
PyMOL> hydrophobicity resi 1-50, rainbow, 7
```

Features:
- Works with any loaded PDB structure in PyMOL
- Flexible selection syntax (chain, residue range, custom selections)
- 8 color palettes for different visualization preferences
- Adjustable smoothing (window_size 1-9+) for different analysis scales
- Immediate visual feedback - changes apply in real-time
- Can be rerun with different parameters to compare visualizations

Rationale:
This extension provides interactive hydrophobicity analysis directly in PyMOL, 
complementing the static plots from the CLI tool. Researchers can:
- Visualize hydrophobicity in 3D structural context
- Quickly test different smoothing levels and color schemes
- Identify hydrophobic patches on protein surface
- Validate computational predictions against structure

The B-factor field is perfect for storing custom per-residue values, and 
PyMOL's spectrum command provides robust gradient coloring.

Verified: Extension colors structures correctly, all parameters work as expected.
