Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(init): Initial commit: project structure and dependencies

Set up the foundational scaffolding for the PyMOL Hydrophobicity Tools project.
This initial commit establishes the Python project structure with essential files:

- Created .gitignore to exclude Python cache files (__pycache__/, *.pyc), 
  generated plots (*.png), PyMOL session files (*.pse), and pytest cache
- Added requirements.txt with core dependencies: BioPython (>=1.79), 
  NumPy (>=1.21.0), and Matplotlib (>=3.3.0) for PDB parsing, numerical 
  computation, and visualization respectively
- Added minimal README.md stub with project title placeholder

This provides the clean starting point needed for systematic development of 
the hydrophobicity analysis toolkit. Dependencies are pinned to minimum 
versions for reproducibility while allowing compatible updates.

Verified: No build/test infrastructure exists yet, appropriate for initial commit.
