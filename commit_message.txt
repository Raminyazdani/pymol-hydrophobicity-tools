Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(docs): Add comprehensive documentation and project identity

Created professional documentation suite to transform the project into a 
portfolio-ready repository with clear usage instructions and project branding.

Documentation files added:

**project_identity.md** - Professional project branding:
- Display title: "PyMOL Hydrophobicity Tools"
- Tagline: "Protein hydrophobicity analysis and visualization toolkit for PyMOL"
- GitHub description covering all three tools
- Primary stack: Python, PyMOL, BioPython, Matplotlib, NumPy
- Topics/keywords: pymol, protein-analysis, hydrophobicity, kyte-doolittle, 
  bioinformatics, structural-biology, computational-biology
- Problem statement and approach
- Clear inputs/outputs documentation

**report.md** - Development process documentation:
- Transformation journey from assignment to portfolio project
- Initial repository analysis
- Pre-change audit findings (19 issues cataloged)
- All applied changes documented with rationale
- Verification process and test results
- Git historian development timeline
- Reproducibility notes and troubleshooting

**README.md** - Complete rewrite from assignment instructions to professional docs:
- "What It Does" section explaining all 3 tools
- Problem & Approach context
- Tech Stack listing
- Setup & Installation instructions
- Detailed usage examples for all tools:
  * visualize_protein.pml (PyMOL visualization)
  * calculate_hydrophobicity.py (CLI analysis)
  * hydrophobicity_pymol.py (PyMOL extension)
- Data Requirements section
- Output Descriptions
- Reproducibility Notes with commands
- Testing Instructions
- Troubleshooting Guide
- References (Kyte-Doolittle citation)

Key improvements:
- Removed all assignment traces (exercises, grading rubrics, student references)
- Added professional context suitable for portfolio
- Clear step-by-step usage examples
- Comprehensive troubleshooting for common issues
- Proper academic citations
- Installation and environment setup guidance

Rationale:
Professional documentation is essential for:
- Portfolio presentation (demonstrates communication skills)
- Usability (clear instructions reduce friction for new users)
- Reproducibility (enables others to use and validate the tools)
- Credibility (shows attention to detail and professionalism)

The README follows best practices for open-source projects: quick overview, 
installation guide, usage examples, troubleshooting, and references.

Verified: Documentation is complete, accurate, and portfolio-appropriate.
