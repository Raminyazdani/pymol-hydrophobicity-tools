Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(extension): Start PyMOL extension for interactive hydrophobicity coloring

⚠️ OOPS: Started extension but used wrong module name in import!

Created the PyMOL extension framework for interactive hydrophobicity coloring, 
but made a typo in the import statement.

What I implemented:
- Created hydrophobicity_pymol.py and hydrophobicity_pymol_template.py
- Added @cmd.extend decorator to register function in PyMOL namespace
- Defined hydrophobicity(selection, palette, window_size) function signature
- Added Kyte-Doolittle scale dictionary (same as CLI tool)
- Planned to import get_residues from calculate_hydrophobicity module

What's wrong:
Used "from calculate_hydro import get_residues" but the actual module is named 
"calculate_hydrophobicity" (missing the "phobicity" part). This is a simple 
typo - I abbreviated the module name while typing from memory.

How I noticed:
Tried to load the extension in PyMOL with "run hydrophobicity_pymol.py" and 
immediately got:
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'calculate_hydro'

Impact:
Extension fails to load completely. Users can't use the interactive hydrophobicity 
coloring feature until the import is fixed. This blocks all testing and usage 
of the extension.

TODO: Fix import to use correct module name "calculate_hydrophobicity" in next commit.

Verified: Import error confirmed when attempting to load in PyMOL.
