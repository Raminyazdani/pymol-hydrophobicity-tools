Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(calculation): Add Kyte-Doolittle scale (incomplete)

⚠️ OOPS: Started adding the Kyte-Doolittle scale but only included partial data!

Created compute_hydrophobicity(residues, window_size=3) function and began 
adding the hydrophobicity scale dictionary, but made an oversight.

What I implemented:
- Function skeleton with residues and window_size parameters
- Started Kyte-Doolittle scale dictionary
- **BUG:** Only added 10 amino acids instead of all 20!
- Missing: ASN, ASP, CYS, GLN, GLU, HIS, LYS, PRO, SER, THR

What's wrong:
The scale is incomplete - if a protein contains any of the missing amino acids, 
the code will crash with a KeyError when trying to look up their hydrophobicity 
values. This makes the function unusable for most real proteins.

How I noticed:
Started testing with a real protein (ubiquitin) and immediately got:
  KeyError: 'ASP'
Realized I had only transcribed half the table from the reference paper.

Impact:
Function cannot process proteins with the standard 20 amino acids. This blocks 
all downstream development and testing.

TODO: Add the remaining 10 amino acids to complete the scale in next commit.

Verified: Partial scale present but incomplete (bug confirmed).
