Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(calculation): Add compute_hydrophobicity function

⚠️ OOPS: Implemented function but forgot to add smoothing logic!

Added the hydrophobicity calculation function, but made a critical oversight - 
the window_size parameter is accepted but not actually used for smoothing.

What I implemented:
- Map residues to Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity values
- Create hydrophobicity_values list by looking up each residue in the scale
- Create average_values list (but just copied raw values without smoothing!)
- Return both lists for plotting

What's wrong:
The function accepts a window_size parameter but ignores it. Instead of 
calculating sliding window averages, I just assigned the raw values directly 
to average_values. This defeats the entire purpose of the smoothing feature.

How I noticed:
Ran the function and compared output to expected smoothed values. The resulting 
plot showed raw noisy data instead of smoothed curves. The values were identical 
in both lists, which shouldn't happen with smoothing.

Impact: 
Users expect smoothed hydrophobicity profiles (which reduce noise and highlight 
trends), but they're getting raw unsmoothed data. This is a functional bug that 
needs immediate fixing.

TODO: Add proper sliding window averaging loop in the next commit.

Verified: Function runs without errors, but produces incorrect smoothed output.
