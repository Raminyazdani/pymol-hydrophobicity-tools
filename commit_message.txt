Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(pymol): Add basic PyMOL visualization script structure

Started building the PyMOL script for protein visualization with essential setup.

Created visualize_protein.pml with:
- fetch 1hz6: Download HIV-1 protease structure from PDB
- as cartoon: Display protein secondary structure
- bg_color white: White background for publication quality
- remove solvent: Delete water molecules

Rationale:
PyMOL scripting automates protein visualization workflows. This initial script 
establishes the foundation with basic protein display and clean rendering setup.

Next step: Add ligand and binding site highlighting.

Verified: Script loads and displays protein structure correctly in PyMOL.
