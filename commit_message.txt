Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(parser): Add get_custom_data_pdb method

Added the second parsing method for extracting substrings from specific column 
positions in PDB lines.

Implemented get_custom_data_pdb(line, start, end) method:
- Extracts substring from PDB line between column indices
- Uses 1-indexed positioning per PDB format specification
- Handles cases where line is shorter than requested range
- Returns extracted string, stripped of whitespace

Example usage:
# Extract residue name from columns 18-20
residue = RaminCalc.get_custom_data_pdb(pdb_line, 18, 20)

Rationale: While get_template_pdb works well for structured record types, 
sometimes we need to extract a specific field by column number (as documented 
in PDB specifications). This method provides direct column-based extraction, 
useful when you know exact positions but don't need a full template.

This complements the template-based approach with a simpler interface for 
single-field extraction tasks.

Next step: Add get_data_pdb method as the high-level interface combining both approaches.

Verified: Method correctly extracts substrings from various column positions.
