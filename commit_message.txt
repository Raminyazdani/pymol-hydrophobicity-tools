Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(extension): Add B-factor storage for hydrophobicity values

Built out the data storage infrastructure using PyMOL's B-factor field to 
prepare for gradient coloring.

Implemented B-factor storage:
- Store hydrophobicity values in B-factor field for each residue
- Use PyMOL's alter command: alter {selection}, b={value}
- One value per residue (stored in corresponding CA atom)
- Values preserved for subsequent spectrum coloring command

B-factor storage strategy:
PyMOL's B-factor field is perfect for custom per-residue values because:
- One value per atom (can be averaged per residue)
- Accessible to PyMOL's coloring commands (spectrum, color b)
- Standard approach for custom residue-level data
- Preserved across PyMOL sessions

Rationale:
Using B-factors is the standard method for custom coloring in PyMOL. This 
approach is well-documented, efficient, and compatible with PyMOL's built-in 
spectrum command. Storing values first, then coloring separately, follows a 
clean separation of concerns.

Next step: Add spectrum coloring command to visualize the stored values.

Verified: B-factors set correctly, values retrievable via PyMOL commands.
