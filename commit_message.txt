Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(calculation): Fix compute_hydrophobicity: add missing sliding window averaging

✅ HOTFIX: Implemented proper sliding window smoothing to fix previous bug.

Fixed the calculation by adding the missing smoothing loop that was overlooked 
in the previous commit.

What I fixed:
- Added for loop to iterate through residues with sliding window
- Implemented proper window slicing: window = hydrophobicity_values[i:i + window_size]
- Calculate average using sum(window) / len(window) for each position
- Build correctly smoothed average_values list
- Handle edge cases where window extends beyond list end

How it works:
For window_size=3 and values [2.5, -1.0, 3.8, 1.9, -0.4]:
- Position 0: avg([2.5, -1.0, 3.8]) = 1.77
- Position 1: avg([-1.0, 3.8, 1.9]) = 1.57
- Position 2: avg([3.8, 1.9, -0.4]) = 1.77
And so on...

Rationale: 
Smoothing with a sliding window is essential for identifying hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic regions while filtering out local noise and outliers. This is the 
standard approach in bioinformatics for sequence analysis. Larger windows 
reveal broader trends (membrane-spanning regions), while smaller windows show 
local variations.

The function now correctly implements the Kyte-Doolittle smoothing methodology 
as described in the original 1982 paper.

Verified: Tested with sample residue list, confirmed smoothed values differ 
from raw values and show expected averaging behavior.
