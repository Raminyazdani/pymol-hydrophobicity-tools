Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(pymol): Start PyMOL visualization script for protein rendering

Started building a PyMOL automation script for standardized protein structure 
visualization.

Created visualize_protein.pml with basic setup:
- fetch 1hz6: Download protein structure from PDB database (HIV-1 protease)
- as cartoon: Display protein in cartoon representation (secondary structure)
- bg_color white: Set white background for publication-quality rendering
- remove solvent: Delete water molecules (reduces clutter, focuses on protein)
- set cartoon_fancy_helices, 1: Enhanced helix rendering with better 3D appearance

Rationale:
PyMOL scripting automates repetitive visualization tasks, ensuring consistent 
rendering across multiple proteins. This is essential for:
- Creating standardized figures for publications and presentations
- Batch processing multiple structures
- Reproducible visualization workflows
- Training and documentation

The script will be extended to highlight specific features like ligands, binding 
sites, and key residues.

Starting with basic setup establishes the foundation - clean protein display 
with water removed and cartoon representation for clarity.

Next steps: Add ligand highlighting, binding site identification, residue 
coloring, and high-quality rendering export.

Verified: Script loads in PyMOL and displays protein structure correctly.
