Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(docs): Add project identity and branding documentation

Created professional project identity documentation for portfolio presentation.

Created project_identity.md with complete branding:
- Display title: "PyMOL Hydrophobicity Tools"
- Repository slug: pymol-hydrophobicity-tools
- Tagline: "Protein hydrophobicity analysis and visualization toolkit for PyMOL"
- Comprehensive GitHub description covering all three tools
- Primary stack: Python 3.x, PyMOL, BioPython, Matplotlib, NumPy
- 10 relevant topics/keywords: pymol, protein-analysis, hydrophobicity, 
  kyte-doolittle, bioinformatics, structural-biology, protein-visualization, 
  computational-biology, python, bioinformatics-tool

Problem & Approach section:
- Clear problem statement (why hydrophobicity analysis matters)
- Description of the three integrated tools
- Explanation of approach and methodology

Inputs & Outputs documentation:
- Lists all input types (PDB files, chain selections, window sizes, etc.)
- Lists all output types (PNG visualizations, plots, PyMOL sessions, values)

Rationale:
Project identity documentation establishes the repository as a professional 
portfolio piece by:
- Providing clear branding and positioning
- Explaining the project's value proposition
- Using appropriate technical terminology
- Positioning the tools in the bioinformatics domain

This documentation serves as the foundation for README content and helps 
potential employers/collaborators quickly understand the project scope and 
technical stack.

Next step: Create comprehensive README based on this identity.

Verified: project_identity.md contains complete, professional branding information.
