Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(analysis): Add support for analyzing with multiple window sizes

Enhanced the CLI to generate multiple plots with different window sizes, 
providing comprehensive analysis at different smoothing levels.

Changes:
- Added loop to iterate over window_sizes [5, 9] in main execution
- Generate separate plots for each window size
- Also process additional windows [3, 7] for comprehensive comparison
- Added file cleanup: os.remove() to delete intermediate window3 file
- Each plot saved with distinct filename including window size

Multi-window analysis benefits:
- Small windows (3): Show local hydrophobicity variations, detect short motifs
- Medium windows (5, 7): Balance between noise reduction and feature detection
- Large windows (9): Reveal broad trends, ideal for transmembrane prediction

Rationale:
Different window sizes reveal different structural features. Membrane-spanning 
regions (~20 residues) are best seen with large windows (9+), while surface 
loops and local patterns require small windows (3-5). Comparing multiple windows 
provides comprehensive analysis - researchers typically examine 3-4 different 
window sizes to understand protein organization at multiple scales.

This follows standard practice in hydrophobicity analysis where no single window 
size is optimal for all features. The Kyte-Doolittle paper recommends window 
sizes of 5-9 for most applications.

The script now produces a complete set of analysis plots in a single run, 
ready for comparative analysis.

Verified: Multiple plots generated with different smoothing levels, all saved 
with correct filenames.
