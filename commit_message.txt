Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(calculation): Complete Kyte-Doolittle scale with all 20 amino acids

✅ HOTFIX: Added the missing 10 amino acids to complete the hydrophobicity scale.

Fixed the incomplete scale by adding all remaining amino acids with their 
correct Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity values.

Added missing amino acids:
- ASN (Asparagine): -3.5 (hydrophilic)
- ASP (Aspartic acid): -3.5 (hydrophilic, acidic)
- CYS (Cysteine): 2.5 (moderately hydrophobic)
- GLN (Glutamine): -3.5 (hydrophilic)
- GLU (Glutamic acid): -3.5 (hydrophilic, acidic)
- HIS (Histidine): -3.2 (hydrophilic)
- LYS (Lysine): -3.9 (highly hydrophilic, basic)
- PRO (Proline): -1.6 (hydrophilic)
- SER (Serine): -0.8 (hydrophilic)
- THR (Threonine): -0.7 (hydrophilic)

Complete scale now includes all 20 standard amino acids:
- Hydrophobic (positive): ILE, VAL, LEU, PHE, CYS, MET, ALA
- Neutral: TRP, GLY
- Hydrophilic (negative): SER, THR, TYR, PRO, HIS, GLU, GLN, ASP, ASN, LYS, ARG

Rationale:
All 20 standard amino acids must be included for the function to work with real 
proteins. The Kyte-Doolittle scale is fully defined for these 20 residues, and 
having an incomplete scale makes the tool unusable.

Reference: Kyte, J., & Doolittle, R. F. (1982). Journal of Molecular Biology, 
157(1), 105-132.

Verified: Scale now complete, function works with all standard amino acids.
