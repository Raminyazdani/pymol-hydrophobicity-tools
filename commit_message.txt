Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(parser): Complete RaminCalc class with all PDB parsing methods

Built out the full PDB parsing utility class with three static methods for 
flexible data extraction from PDB format files.

Implemented methods:
- get_data_pdb(line, template): Extracts data from a PDB line using a template 
  string that specifies column widths (e.g., "6s5s1s4s" for ATOM records)
- get_custom_data_pdb(line, start, end): Extracts a substring from a PDB line 
  between specified column indices (1-indexed per PDB spec)
- get_template_pdb(line, template): Helper method that splits a line according 
  to template format, handling whitespace and fixed-width columns

Rationale: The PDB format uses rigid column-based positioning specified in the 
PDB format documentation. These static methods provide reusable utilities for 
parsing any PDB line format, following the template pattern for maintainability. 
This approach is flexible enough to handle ATOM, HETATM, and other record types.

The RaminCalc class is now complete and ready to be used by the residue 
extraction function (get_residues) which will be implemented next.

Verified: Methods correctly parse PDB format with proper column handling.
