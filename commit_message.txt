Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(extraction): Complete get_residues with full CA atom filtering

Finished the residue extraction implementation with proper filtering for chain 
selection and alpha carbon (CA) atoms.

Complete implementation:
- Open and read PDB file line by line
- Filter for ATOM records only (excludes HETATM, water, etc.)
- Filter for chain A residues specifically
- Filter for CA (alpha carbon) atoms only - one per residue
- Extract 3-letter amino acid codes using RaminCalc.get_data_pdb()
- Remove duplicates while maintaining sequence order
- Return clean list of residue codes (e.g., ['MET', 'GLY', 'ALA', ...])

Rationale: Alpha carbon (CA) atoms represent the protein backbone and occur 
exactly once per residue, making them perfect for hydrophobicity analysis. 
This avoids counting the same residue multiple times (which would happen if 
we used all atoms). Focusing on chain A is standard for single-chain protein 
analysis.

The function now correctly extracts the amino acid sequence from a PDB file 
in the proper order, ready for hydrophobicity mapping.

Verified: Correctly extracts residues from test PDB file with proper filtering.
