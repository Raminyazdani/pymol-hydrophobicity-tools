Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(extension): Add basic PyMOL extension with residue extraction

Started building the complete PyMOL extension for interactive hydrophobicity 
visualization with focus on data extraction and preparation.

Implemented initial functionality:
- Define hydrophobicity() function with @cmd.extend decorator
- Parameters: selection, palette, window_size
- Extract residues from PyMOL selection using iterate command
- Map each residue to Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity values
- Apply smoothing if window_size > 1

Data extraction approach:
- Use PyMOL's iterate command to get residue codes from selection
- Build list of 3-letter amino acid codes
- Map to hydrophobicity scale
- Prepare smoothed values for coloring

Rationale:
The extension needs to extract protein data from PyMOL's internal structure 
before applying hydrophobicity analysis. This initial implementation focuses 
on data extraction and preparation, establishing the foundation for coloring.

Next step: Add B-factor storage mechanism.

Verified: Extension extracts residues and calculates hydrophobicity correctly.
