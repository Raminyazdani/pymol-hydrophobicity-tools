Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(visualization): Add basic matplotlib plotting

Implemented basic visualization functionality to generate hydrophobicity plots.

Changes:
- Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- Added plotting code in compute_hydrophobicity() function
- Create line plot: x-axis = amino acid position (1-indexed)
- Y-axis = hydrophobicity value
- Plot hydrophobicity_values as blue line
- Add axis labels: "Amino Acid Position" and "Hydrophobicity"
- Save plot to PNG file using OUTPUT_PREFIX
- Call plt.clf() to clear figure after saving

Basic plot features:
- Simple line graph showing hydrophobicity profile
- Saved as {OUTPUT_PREFIX}_plot_window{window_size}.png
- Clear axis labels for readability

Rationale:
Visual representation is essential for identifying patterns in protein sequences. 
The basic plot provides the foundation for hydrophobicity analysis. This initial 
implementation focuses on core functionality - a clear line plot showing the 
hydrophobicity values across the protein sequence.

Next step: Enhance plotting with both raw and smoothed values on same plot.

Verified: Basic plots generated correctly with proper axis labels.
