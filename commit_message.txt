Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(visualization): Enhance plotting with dual-line visualization

Enhanced the plotting to show both raw and smoothed hydrophobicity values on 
the same plot for better comparative analysis.

Changes:
- Plot average_values (smoothed) as thicker blue line (linewidth=2)
- Plot hydrophobicity_values (raw) as thin red line (linewidth=1, alpha=0.5)
- Added legend to distinguish the two lines
- Added title indicating window size used
- Both series share the same x-axis (amino acid position)

Dual-line benefits:
- Compare raw data against smoothed trend simultaneously
- See local variations (raw) and broader patterns (smoothed) together
- Validate that smoothing is working correctly
- Understand noise level in the raw data

Rationale:
Showing both raw and smoothed values helps researchers:
- Identify if smoothing is appropriate for their analysis
- Detect outliers and local features that might be lost in smoothing
- Validate computational results visually
- Choose appropriate window sizes by seeing the smoothing effect

This visualization approach is standard in bioinformatics sequence analysis 
where comparing filtered vs. unfiltered data provides important insights.

Verified: Enhanced plots show both lines with clear distinction and legend.
