Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | WIP(cli): Add command-line interface for running calculations

⚠️ OOPS: Added CLI but forgot to validate arguments!

Implemented the main entry point to make the script executable from command 
line, but made a common beginner mistake with argument parsing.

What I implemented:
- Added if __name__ == "__main__": block for script execution
- Read PDB filename from sys.argv[1]
- Call get_residues(pdb_file) to extract residues
- (Planned) Call compute_hydrophobicity for analysis

What's wrong:
Accessed sys.argv[1] directly without checking len(sys.argv) first. If a user 
runs the script without providing a PDB file argument, Python raises:
  IndexError: list index out of range

How I noticed:
Tried to run the script from command line without arguments to see what would 
happen (expecting a usage message), but it crashed immediately with an unhelpful 
IndexError before even reaching any of my code.

Impact:
This makes the tool user-hostile. Instead of getting a helpful "Usage: ..." 
message, users get a confusing stack trace. This is especially problematic for 
bioinformatics tools used by researchers who may not be familiar with Python 
error messages.

TODO: Add len(sys.argv) check and print usage message in next commit.

Verified: Script crashes with IndexError when run without arguments (bug confirmed).
