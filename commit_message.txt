Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(cli): Fix CLI: add argument validation and usage message

✅ HOTFIX: Added proper argument checking to prevent IndexError crashes.

Fixed the CLI bug by validating sys.argv length before accessing arguments.

What I fixed:
- Added if len(sys.argv) < 2: validation check
- Print clear usage message with example: "Usage: python calculate_hydrophobicity.py <pdb_file>"
- Exit cleanly with sys.exit(1) for invalid usage (standard UNIX convention)
- Now safely access sys.argv[1] only after validation

Example interaction:
Before (broken):
  $ python calculate_hydrophobicity.py
  IndexError: list index out of range

After (fixed):
  $ python calculate_hydrophobicity.py
  Usage: python calculate_hydrophobicity.py <pdb_file>
  [exits with code 1]

Rationale:
Robust command-line tools must validate inputs and provide helpful error 
messages. This is especially important for scientific tools used by researchers 
who may not be Python experts. Clear usage messages improve usability and reduce 
support burden.

This follows standard CLI best practices: validate early, fail fast with clear 
messages, use conventional exit codes (0 for success, 1 for user error).

Verified: Script now displays usage message when run without arguments, exits 
cleanly without stack traces.
