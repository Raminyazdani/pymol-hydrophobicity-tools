Ramin Yazdani | pymol-hydrophobicity-tools | main | feat(testing): Add basic unit test fixtures

Set up the testing infrastructure with pytest fixtures for creating test PDB files.

Implemented test fixtures:
- @pytest.fixture temp_pdb_file: Creates temporary PDB file for testing
- Generates realistic PDB format with ATOM records
- Includes chain A with CA (alpha carbon) atoms
- Test sequence: MET, GLY, ALA (3 residues)
- Proper PDB column formatting (fixed-width fields)
- Automatic cleanup using tempfile module

PDB test data structure:
- Line 1: ATOM record for MET CA at position 1
- Line 2: ATOM record for GLY CA at position 2
- Line 3: ATOM record for ALA CA at position 3
- Includes coordinates, occupancy, B-factor fields

Rationale:
Testing requires realistic test data that matches actual PDB format. The fixture 
approach provides:
- Reusable test data across multiple test functions
- Automatic file cleanup after tests complete
- Isolation between tests (fresh file each time)
- Realistic PDB format for validating parsing code

Using pytest fixtures follows best practices for test organization and makes 
tests more maintainable.

Next step: Add actual test functions using these fixtures.

Verified: Fixtures generate valid temporary PDB files with correct format.
